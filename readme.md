## TITLE: Minecraft Utilities

This website will contain useful calculators that could aid players in their Minecraft journey. The calculators
included on this webpage are an end portal trianglation calculator, experience points calculator, overworld-nether
coordinates calculator, and transportation speed calculator. The fifth webpage will be the homepage, a directory
to the calculators.

## DESCRIPTION OF THE WEBPAGES:

- End Portal Triangulation: Using two eye of ender throws and their information, calculate the coordinates of the
  stronghold.
- Experience Points: Calculate how much experience points are needed to level up from an initial level to a final level.
- Overworld-Nether Coordinates: Given Overworld coordinates, calculate Nether Coordinates, or vice versa.
- Transportation Speed: Given a starting point and destination point, calculate the travel time for different transport
  options!

## FEATURES:
- Mobile and Desktop UI compatible
- Saves input data in a dedicated history tab for each page
- Responsive UI that makes use of HTML to make it more navigable and make it pop out more

## DETAILS:
- History tab data is named after the output value by default but can be renamed by the user.
- Responsive UI is navigable with the tab key, has reactions/pseudoclasses for each important element, and separates unaesthetic block text for tutorials/explanations with either a background box to more easily corral them or a popup window attached to a button. 

## JS UTILIZATION:
All of these calculators will use Javascript to calculate desired values and validate inputs.

## DEFINITION OF DONE:
- Tutorial/explanation text per page cleaned up
   - End portal triangulation tutorial moved to a button and popup instead of a separate page
- Buttons, links, and inputs navigable with tab, enter, and arrow keys
- UI still looks coherent and user-friendly when viewed on mobile
- History tabs on all pages
